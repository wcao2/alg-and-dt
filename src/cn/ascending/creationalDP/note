what are the design pattern you have known?
I use factory design pattern to generate connection to database. The connection object is called session in Hibernate.
I implement sessionFactory which reused the similar attributes, like domain(url), username, password to generate session or we called connection.
That simplified session construction process.
Build dp is similar to the factory dp, we can use build dp to generate obj again and again. T
he only difference is that build dp provides optional argument to generate obj a little bit diff during each build process.
